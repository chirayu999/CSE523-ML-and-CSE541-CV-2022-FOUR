# CSE523-ML-and-CSE541-CV-2022-FOUR

## The motive for this project is to create a driver assistance system that helps in vehicle and lane detection in the surrounding while also alerting in the case of lane departure

## The vehicle detection model produces bounding boxes around a vehicle. For example, in this frame there are two cars that are detected by the ML model (SVM)
